# DATA INFO
```{r}
d1 = Cars93
dim(d1)
class(d1)
str(d1)
```
# SUBSETTING
```{r}
d2 = d1[c(1:9),c(2,4,9)]
d2

d2 = data.frame(manufacturer=d1$Manufacturer,price=d1$Price)

# Ford Cars

# cars weighting > 4000
d2 = d1[d1$Weight>4000,]

```
## COUNTING

```{r}
# number of cars by DriveTrain
unique(d1$DriveTrain)
table(d1$DriveTrain)

# by two factors
table(d1$AirBags,d1$DriveTrain)

# by three factors
ftable(d1$AirBags,d1$DriveTrain,d1$Passengers)
```

# MEASURING

```{r}
# median weight per DriveTrain
aux1 = tapply(d1$Weight,d1$DriveTrain,median)
aux1
